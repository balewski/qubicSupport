Simulation of impact of finite T1,T2, readout error  fidelity of Bell-state with repeated CZ gates on X4Y2

Defualt nosie model is in
noise_conf/qubicAps24.yaml

Run list of circuits for fixed noise model:
sim_T1T2_Bell$ ./run_aer_job.py -p
Plot is produced


Scan grid if T1-T2 for fixed other params
a) batch_simu.sh  , takes about 12 min on laptop
b) merge_experiments.py
c) ~/sim_T1T2_Bell$ ./pl_T1T2_surf.py
plot 2D map of TVD (total variational distance)
   ['true_probs']=[0.5,0.,0.,0.5]
    meas_prob=raw_mshot/nshot
    # Compute the absolute difference and sum it across the probability dimension
    abs_diff_sum = np.sum(np.abs(true_prob - meas_prob), axis=1)
    meas_tvd=0.5*abs_diff_sum
